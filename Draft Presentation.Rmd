## Goal: Recreate confusion matrix of 2018 NBA data and compare to the 2022 season

- Use a confusion matrix to determine outcomes of predicting top player status
- Group top 15 players and create a heat map/confusion matrix to predict top player status
- Recreate heat mapped confusion matrix or a single row.
- Goal is to predict as many NBA All-Stars as possible.


## Their Confusion Matrix

```{r}
corr18 <- readRDS("corr18.rds")
corr18
```

## Our Confusion Matrix

```{r}
corr1 <- readRDS("corr1.rds")
corr1
```
